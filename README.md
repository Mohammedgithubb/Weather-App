# Weather-App
This is a simple Java web application developed using Servlets, JSP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It integrates with the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for a given city and display it to the user.

The application has a simple user interface, where the user can enter the name of a city and click on a button to fetch the weather data.
The weather data is displayed in a table, which includes the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other weather conditions.
